# Security and permissions

The monday apps MCP uses your existing API token for authentication. Your AI assistant can only perform actions that your token is authorized to do within the apps framework.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

* Node.js v20 or higher
* npm v5.2.0 or higher
* A monday.com [API token](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/authentication)
* A supported AI assistant or IDE

## Add monday apps MCP to your AI assistant

Add the monday.com MCP server to your AI assistant’s MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monday-apps-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@mondaydotcomorg/monday-api-mcp",
        "-t",
        "your_monday_API_token", // Replace with your actual API token
        "--mode", 
        "apps" // // Enables apps framework tools; without it, the server runs as the monday platform MCP for workspace automation
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

# Example prompts

Once connected, you can manage your apps using natural language. For example:

* **Create a new app:**\
  "Create a new monday app called 'Customer Health Analyzer' with a board view and a dashboard widget."
* **Manage versions:**\
  "Show all versions of app 12345 and indicate which one is live."\
  "Promote the latest draft version of app 12345 to live."
* **Check deployments:**\
  "Check the deployment status for app version 67890 and show any errors."
* **Configure environment:**\
  "Set an API\_KEY environment variable for app 12345."
* **Work with storage:**\
  "Search app 12345 storage for records containing 'user\_preferences'."\
  "Export all storage data for app 12345 as JSON."
